# Code of Conduct

The [Holloway Community Slack Group](https://docs.google.com/forms/u/1/d/1vSCq-BfCQxg_B39OxWFi0vYHND_ImhBYfK8GQYbL2YE/edit?usp=drive_web) exists for to facilitate communication, the sharing of ideas, and encouragement between three groups: Holloway readers, invited contributors, and staff. We believe having an open channel of communication between these groups will help us achieve our long-term purpose: To offer helpful guidance with long-term value that is trustworthy and accessible. (See our [Editorial Principles](https://www.holloway.com/g/editorial-principles) for more detail.)

In order to build community that is **truly helpful**, we believe the environment in this Slack group must be kind, safe, and inclusive; free from intimidation or harassment.

## TL;DR

- Remember the main goal is to be **helpful**.
- Be actively kind.
- We're here to help: Andy Sparks (@andy) and Josh Levy (@jlevy)
- Abusive behavior is never tolerated.
- Data published to the Holloway Community is hosted at the discretion of the administrators, and may be removed.
- Violations of this code may result in permanent expulsion from the Holloway Community Slack.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contribute to a helpful, positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Scope

We expect all members of the Holloway Community, including administrators, users, and contributors to abide by this Code of Conduct at all times in the Holloway Community Slack Group. 

The definitions of various subjective terms such as "discriminatory," "hateful," "or "confusing," will be decided at the sole discretion of the Holloway Community administrators: Andy Sparks and Josh Levy.

## Friendly, Helpful, Harassment-Free Space

We are committed to providing a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity, religion, age, physical appearance, body size, race, or similar personal characteristics.

We ask that you please respect that people have differences of opinion regarding technical choices, and acknowledge that every design or implementation choice carries a trade-off and numerous costs. There is seldom a single right answer. A difference of technology preferences is never a license to be rude.

Any spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting, or other attention-stealing behavior is not welcome, and will not be tolerated.

Harassing other users of Holloway is never tolerated, whether via public or private media.

Avoid using offensive or harassing package names, nicknames, or other identifiers that might detract from a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all.

Harassment includes, but is not limited to: harmful or prejudicial verbal or written comments related to gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity, religion, age, physical appearance, body size, race, or similar personal characteristics; inappropriate use of nudity, sexual images, and/or sexually explicit language in public spaces; threats of physical or non-physical harm; deliberate intimidation, stalking or following; harassing photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact; and unwelcome sexual attention.

## Acceptable Content

The Holloway Community administrators reserve the right to make judgement calls about what is and isn't appropriate in published content. These are guidelines to help you be successful in our community.

Content must contain something applicable to the previously stated goals of the Holloway Community. "Spamming", that is, publishing any form of content that is not applicable, is not allowed.

Content must not contain illegal or infringing content. You should only publish content to Holloway if you have the right to do so. This includes complying with all software license agreements or other intellectual property restrictions. For example, redistributing an MIT-licensed module with the copyright notice removed, would not be allowed. You will be responsible for any violation of laws or othersâ€™ intellectual property rights.

Content must not be malware. For example, content (code, video, pictures, words, etc.) which is designed to maliciously exploit or damage computer systems, is not allowed.

Content name, description, and other visible metadata must not include abusive, inappropriate, or harassing content.

## Reporting Violations of this Code of Conduct

If you believe someone is harassing you or has otherwise violated this Code of Conduct, please reach out to Andy Sparks (@andy) or Josh Levy (@jlevy) and send us an abuse report. Please include as much detail as possible as it is easiest for us to address issues when we have more context.

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated, and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The Holloway Community administrators are obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. In general, we will choose the course of action that we judge as being most in the interest of fostering a safe and friendly community.

You are also encouraged to contact us if you are curious about something that might be "on the line" between appropriate and inappropriate content. We are happy to provide guidance to help you be a successful part of our community.

## Consequences

Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including employees, customers, or others with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.

If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the Holloway Community administrators may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning.
